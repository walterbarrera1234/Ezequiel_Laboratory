      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>This research proposal outlines a self-guided microdosing protocol for choline, aimed at enhancing cognitive performance, focus, and emotional regulation. Drawing inspiration from nootropic theory and neurobiological models of acetylcholine function, the project aims to track subjective and objective metrics to determine the efficacy of low-dose choline administration in a real-world setting.</p>

      <h2>Motivation / Background</h2>
      <p>Acetylcholine is a critical neurotransmitter involved in attention, learning, and memory. While choline supplementation has been explored in clinical and nootropic contexts, the concept of <strong>microdosing</strong> — taking sub-threshold doses — remains underexplored.</p>
      <p>As someone deeply engaged in cognitively demanding tasks involving mathematics, data analysis, and long-form focused work, I am proposing a methodical exploration of whether microdosing choline can enhance mental clarity without the common side effects of higher doses, such as tension headaches or overstimulation.</p>

      <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved sustained attention and task-switching ability</li>
        <li>Decreased subjective mental fatigue</li>
        <li>Enhanced verbal fluency and working memory recall</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Dosage Protocol</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Compound:</strong> Alpha-GPC or CDP-Choline (TBD based on bioavailability and tolerability)</li>
        <li><strong>Microdose Range:</strong> 25–50mg per dose</li>
        <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> 1–2x daily, taken:
          <ul>
            <li>30 minutes before cognitively intensive tasks</li>
            <li>Or during natural cognitive troughs (early afternoon)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A control period (no choline use) and a washout period will also be incorporated.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Measurement & Metrics</h2>
      <p><strong>Objective Tools:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Typing speed / accuracy tests</li>
        <li>N-back working memory games</li>
        <li>Timed problem-solving exercises</li>
        <li>Reaction time measurements (e.g. Human Benchmark)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Subjective Journaling:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Self-rated focus, clarity, emotional regulation</li>
        <li>Sleep quality</li>
        <li>Mood and irritability levels</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tracking will be done daily via Notion or a custom dashboard.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Risks and Safety Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Microdosing limits will remain well below the standard 250–500mg dose range.</li>
        <li>No additional choline-heavy foods (e.g. liver, eggs) will be consumed during test days unless planned.</li>
        <li>If any side effects such as irritability or muscle tightness emerge, dosage will be halted or reduced.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Anticipated Outcomes & Broader Implications</h2>
      <p>If successful, this experiment could suggest a safe, practical method of enhancing cognitive performance using a low-cost, widely available compound. It would also contribute to a broader understanding of how targeted micronutrient microdosing can be integrated into performance optimization frameworks, especially for high-output thinkers and creatives.</p>
