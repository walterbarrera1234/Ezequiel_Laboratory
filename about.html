      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m a mathematician, data analyst, and builder. During my degree, I focused on advanced mathematics, problem solving, and helping others learn. I took a nontraditional route, made a lot of mistakes, and came out stronger for it.</p>

      <p>Right now, I build tools, dashboards, and systems — anything that helps people work better. I’m obsessed with understanding things at a deep level and don’t accept fake clarity. I like to work on projects that connect real people to meaningful solutions.</p>

      <h2>Courses Taken</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Calculus I, II, III:</strong> Taught me to understand the world in a physical sense.</li>
        <li><strong>Linear Algebra:</strong> Pattern recognition for systems of objects.</li>
        <li><strong>Abstract Algebra:</strong> More pattern recognition, but abstract and fancy.</li>
        <li><strong>Real Analysis:</strong> Taught me how to be a pedantic pain in the ass and dive deep.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Analysis:</strong> Showed me how to think abstractly.</li>
        <li><strong>Differential Equations:</strong> Motion, motion, motion.</li>
        <li><strong>Topology:</strong> Generality of spaces and what makes them unique.</li>
        <li><strong>Partial Differential Equations:</strong> That ODEs live inside PDEs, and we can deconstruct complex motions into solvable pieces.</li>
        <li><strong>Mathematical Modeling:</strong> Turning messy reality into something math pretends to handle.</li>
        <li><strong>Probability & Statistics:</strong> Taught me how to love myself—because it was when I hated myself most.</li>
        <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Showed me the craziness of AI and that these systems need deep refining.</li>
