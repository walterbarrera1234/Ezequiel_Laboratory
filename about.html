      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m a mathematician, data analyst, and builder. During my degree, I focused on advanced mathematics, problem solving, and helping others learn. I took a nontraditional route, made a lot of mistakes, and came out stronger for it.</p>

      <p>Right now, I build tools, dashboards, and systems — anything that helps people work better. I’m obsessed with understanding things at a deep level and don’t accept fake clarity. I like to work on projects that connect real people to meaningful solutions.</p>

      <p>Outside of work, I train hard, play tennis, and write about the way I see the world. I’m building something bigger than a career — I’m building a life that’s mine.</p>
